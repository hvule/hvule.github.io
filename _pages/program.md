Apart from working on microeconomics theory, I am also passionate about algorithms and programming. 
While not entirely a tech geek, I am a tech enthusiast who ardently supports Blockchain, A.I., Large Language Models (LLMs), and Quantum Computing. I embrace innovative technologies and the latest trends, such as cryptocurrency and ChatGPT. I have three years of experience working as a full-time programmer, gaining expertise in:

* Languages: .NET (C, C#, SharePoint, ASP, WPF, WinForms), basic C/C++, PHP
* Databases: MS SQL, Oracle
* Numerical Analysis: Python, Julia, MATLAB
* Version Control Systems: GIT, SVN
