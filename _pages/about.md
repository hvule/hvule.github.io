Hi ya,

Welcome to my website. My name is Vu Le (Dave). I am the last-year PhD in Economics at Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow. I hope that you will explore something interesting, and might be useful from my website. Persuing a PhD in Economics, for me, is a glittering journey, yet sometimes coupled with challenging moments. You are warmly welcomed here, just stay tuned and feel free to drop me an email if have any questions.
